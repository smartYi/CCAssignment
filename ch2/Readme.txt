These source code are for the problems in chapter2.
So I define a LinkedListNode in LinkedListNode.java.
If you run any source code in this folder, import LinkedListNode.java file and this is necessity.

Also pay attention to Solution07.java, another java file called Result.java should also be involved if you run Solution07.java.
